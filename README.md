# transformer-variants-cifar10
Exploration of efficient Transformers (Performers) for image classification on CIFAR-10. Implemented ViT and Performer variants (ReLU, GELU, EXP, fÎ¸), with PyTorch and Optuna. Benchmarked accuracy, efficiency trade-offs, and documented results in an anonymized report.
